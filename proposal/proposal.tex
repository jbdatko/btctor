\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
Tor is an overlay network that uses onion routing to anonymize
Internet Protocol (IP) communication to defend against traffic
analysis.  There are several categories of users that benefit from
this service.  Tor protects normal users from collections attempts for
advertisements or market research and also prevents their Internet
service provider from being aware of their browsing history.  However,
governments also use Tor for intelligence gathering or to mask their
IP address while conducting sting operations.  Also, Tor is used by
users as a circumvention tool\cite{tor-internet-days}.  In countries
like China with a strong state-sponsored censorship to
activists\cite{china-censorship}, Tor provides a means to allow access
to the unfiltered Internet.

However, the Tor network is at serious risk of exceeding available capacity,
both in terms of available bridge IP addresses as well as in terms of
exit relay bandwidth\cite{tor-internet-days}.  The Tor network is
mainly supported by volunteers and previous efforts to increase the
number of relays have been through public
campaigns\cite{eff-campaign} with some success.  However, Tor still
suffers from a "tragedy of the commons\cite{Hardin_1968_Commons}"
since there are not many incentives to run a relay besides altruism.
Even though users receive better anonymity against some attacks while
running a relay\cite{better-anon-tor-relay}, Tor is still in demand of
more relay operators.

Finding the correct incentive for Tor relays without reducing the
anonymity in Tor is challenging.  As we show in Section
\ref{sec:related}, there are several proposed methods however all are
focused on improving the Quality of Service (QoS) for relay
operators.  These methods require subtle modifications to the Tor
network to compensate for the adjusted QoS.  We propose a system to
simply increase the number of relay operators by incentive them
with monetary payments with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash currency that uses a
proof-of-work based model\cite{nakamoto2009bitcoin}.  It has seen
increasing popularity since it's release in 2009 and there exists
several exchanges to convert Bitcoin in various national currencies.
New Bitcoins enter the market by "mining."  However, as there are
fixed number of Bitcoins, successive Bitcoins become harder (take more
computational resources) to mine.  To account for the increased
difficulty, computers join a mining
pool\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1112-4980} to contribute to larger
computation resource, however the reward is now shared amount all miners.


\section{Approach}\label{sec:approach}

The goal of this research is to assess the feasibility of a Bitcoin
Tor incentive system.  First, we intend to identify the problems and
challenges with such a design.  In addition to the anonymity analysis,
we indent to comment on other issues like possible data retention
problems introduced through payments\cite{data-retention}.
Unfortunately, through monetary incentives we may actually reduce the
number of relays since volunteers may be demotivated to provide the
service for free\cite{RePEc:eee:joepsy:v:30:y:2009:i:3:p:500-508} and
we plan to provide on discussion on this issue as well.


We will consider two Bitcoin payments
methods.  One using Zerocoin\cite{Miers:2013:ZAD:2497621.2498124}, an
anonymous Bitcoin approach.  The other will outline an approach with
the pseudo-anonymous Bitcoin and evaluate if it hinders the anonymity
of Tor.  Bitcoin is not anonymous\cite{journals/iacr/AndroulakiKRSC12}
and can not be combined with Tor to expose Tor users.

A potential approach is to have the Tor client also join a
decentralized, peer-to-peer mining pool such as P2Pool.  Ideally, as a
results of the client's work, the mining pool would pay the bridge or
relay directly without exposing the client.  A more complicate
scenario is when a client has Bitcoin and wants to spend it without
mining.  A priority for the research is to outline a system for this
use-case without compromising anonymity.

As a result of payment scheme investigation, we intend analyze the
trade-offs of required Bitcoin servers or ones that optionally accept
payments.  Servers that require payment may help categorize Tor users
(and thus degrade anonymity).  Perhaps a payment system that is
randomized can improve anonymity will still offering a certain
expected value of benefit.

Then we will compare our incentive system with other systems such as
BRAIDS\cite{Jansen:2010:RNT:1866307.1866344},
PAR\cite{raykova-pet2008}, and LIRA\cite{lira-ndss13}.  Following a
comparison, we will provide our solutions to the identified problems
and analyze the impact on anonymity.  The anonymity goal is to not
degrade the protection provided by Tor by introducing the Bitcoin
incentive.

Lastly, we will prototype the system and analyze the results.  The
system will required a modified Tor client that potentially includes
Bitcoin mining pool software and a modified relay that accepts the
Bitcoins.  Incentives have been shown to increase Tor performance
\cite{"Johnny"Ngan:2010:BIT:2163571.2163590}, so we intend to focus on
the performance of our Bitcoin payment protocol in Tor.


\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
Tor projects leaders have identified the need for additional relays
and have suggested that incentives should be
considered\cite{"Johnny"Ngan:2010:BIT:2163571.2163590}.  In that same
paper they also present the ``Gold Star'' incentive system, which
unfortunately creates a noticeable subset of prioritized Tor users.  A
payment incentive system was suggested by PAR\cite{raykova-pet2008},
however it relied on centralized bank which compromises anonymity.  A
QoS incentive scheme, BRAIDS, was proposed that claimed it â€œallows
relays to achieve 75\% lower latency than non-relays for interactive
traffic, and 90\% higher bandwidth utilization for non-interactive
traffic\cite{Jansen:2010:RNT:1866307.1866344}".  A related QoS
incentive system was introduced with LIRA that was based on a
cryptographic lottery\cite{lira-ndss13}.

Bitcoin privacy has been evaluated and it has been shown that
approximately 40\% of users can be
de-anonymized\cite{journals/iacr/AndroulakiKRSC12}.  Using networking
flow analysis combined with the inherent public transaction ledger, it
is also possible to identify Bitcoin users\cite{journals/corr/abs-1107-4524}.


\subsection{Novelty}\label{sec:novelty}
This is the first research to consider Bitcoin as the incentive
mechanism for Tor.  Unlike LIRA and BRAIDS, it does not intended to
redefine the QoS and unlike PAR, it does not use a centralized bank.

We believe that a monetary incentive will increase relay and bridge
participation more so than QoS based incentives.  While increased QoS
is attractive for certain users, we feel that monetary incentives
have wider appeal and will scale with increased usage in Tor.

If feasible, the mining pool payment to a node that did not perform
the proof-of-work is novel.  Normally, the Bitcoin miner desires
payment for its efforts in computation, but we are not aware of a
charity-like payment mechanism in Bitcoin.




\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}
A security analysis focusing on anonymity will be provided for each
Bitcoin incentive system.
